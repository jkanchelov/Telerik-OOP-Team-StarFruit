The other classes are similar to that. The project also has Exception class, Bag class, Catalogue class, Factory class,Menu class. 

Tests
-----------
At present the tests are only for the class Catalogue. While this class is being tested we test also a lot of other classes. We've planned to make individual tests for other classes.
