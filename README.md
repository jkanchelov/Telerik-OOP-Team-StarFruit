**Motivation and purpose of project**
---------------
This project was started because of the task from Telerik Academy for group projects. Our puprose was to create a console application that simulates an online store. 
The application supports two types of login: login as an administrator and login as a customer. The administrator can add and remove products from the catalogue. 
The customers can review products in catalogue and can add them to their bag. If they decide that any product in the bag is excessive, they can remove it. 
The final step of shopping is paying. The customer receive the bill and the application is ready to serve another customer.

**Class Diagram**
------------
This diagram shows the basic hierarchy of classes. The base class is Product and it is inherited by the four sub-base classes that represent the main product groups. All other classes inherit them. The project also has an Exception class, a Bag class, a Catalogue class, a Factory class and a Menu class.
